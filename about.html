    <h1>Our Vision</h1>
    <p>OUR VISION
        A world in which anyone can create their future
        Our vision is one that strives to connect our African people 
        to the future they envision for themselves. 
         This is the goal in-front of us and it keeps us striving for more. 
         Simply putâ€¦we will know we are succeeding when people working in tech 
         in Africa have the same earning potential as their global counterparts 
         possessing the same aptitude and mindset.</p>
